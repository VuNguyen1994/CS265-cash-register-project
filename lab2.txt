Q8. The diffence is that there is an extra file spellExample.bak appeared in the directory. 
dln45@tux5 Lab02> ls -a
.  ..  breadIsDangerous.txt  list  spellExample  spellExample.bak  Tmp

Q9. Output
dln45@tux5 Lab02> diff spellExample.bak spellExample
1c1
< I went to a gadren party
---
> I went to a garden party
3c3
< bnuch of my old freinds did somehting
---
> bunch of my old friends did something
5a6
> An extra line
Explain: 
1c1 means the first lines of both files have to be changed (c is change) to make the two files identical.
< means the line of the first file, > mean the line of the second file
3c3 means the third lines of both files are different. 
The first 3 is the third line of the first file.
The second 3 is the third line of the second file.
5a6 means there is a line needed to be added in order to make both files the same.
> means the "An extra line" belongs to the spellExample at line 6.
spellExample.bak does not have "An extra line".

Q10. Nothing in the output because there is no difference, we are comparing the same file. 
dln45@tux5 Lab02> diff spellExample spellExample
dln45@tux5 Lab02>

Q11. Output of sort numbers is not as expected. Because it sorts digit by digit.
So, even the number is smaller, but with its first digit is larger (6 and 9), it will be placed at the end of the list.
dln45@tux5 Lab02> sort numbers
1
15
17
20
24
26
28
29
6
9

Q12. Output is different with sort -n numbers.
-n option will sort the file numberically. 
dln45@tux5 Lab02> sort -n numbers
1
6
9
15
17
20
24
26
28
29

Q13. Output. 
dln45@tux5 Lab02> ls -oh | sort -k4 -h -r
-rw-r-xr-- 1 dln45 2.9K Jan 17 08:46 breadIsDangerous.txt
-rw-r-xr-- 1 dln45  111 Jan 17 21:38 spellExample
-rw-r-xr-- 1 dln45   97 Jan 17 21:23 spellExample.bak
drwxrwxr-x 2 dln45   36 Jan 17 08:19 Tmp
-rw-r-xr-- 1 dln45   27 Jan 17 21:57 numbers
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dln45   13 Jan 17 08:15 list
total 5.5K
Sort -k4 will create a table of output and sort by the 4th column.
-h is to print the results in the human readable format. 
-r will sort the output following reverse order. 
So in this case, breadIsDangerous.txt is 2.9K in size to it goes first. 

Q14. Command to show the 8 largest files in my course directory
Output:
dln45@tux5 CS265> du -ah | sort -rh | head -8
248K    .
240K    ./lab1
46K     ./lab1/emacs_lab
46K     ./lab1/#emacs_lab#
33K     ./lab1/vi_lab
28K     ./lab1/.vi_lab.swo
24K     ./lab1/.vi_lab.swm
24K     ./lab1/.vi_lab.swl

Q15. Output. echo $? will read the return value of the previous command.
There is 'dough' in the file so the return value is 0.
There is no 'uniqueString'in the file so the return value is 1.
And in third case, there is an error opening the file noSuhcFile so the return value is 2. 
dln45@tux5 Lab02> grep dough breadIsDangerous.txt
dln45@tux5 Lab02> echo $?
0
dln45@tux5 Lab02> grep uniqueString breadIsDangerous.txt
dln45@tux5 Lab02> echo $?
1
dln45@tux5 Lab02> grep dough noSuchFile
grep: noSuchFile: No such file or directory
dln45@tux5 Lab02> echo $?
2

Q16. Output
dln45@tux5 Lab02> f=breadIsDangerous.txt
dln45@tux5 Lab02> echo "File $f has $(cat "$f" | wc -w) words"
File breadIsDangerous.txt has 499 words

Q17. Command that would output: 
The current directory is: /home/dln45/CS265/Lab02
dln45@tux5 Lab02> echo "The current directory is: $PWD"
