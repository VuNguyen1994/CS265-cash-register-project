Q3.2 git reset:
removes all pending changes from the index 
and does nothing to the working tree
git reset --hard: 
clears the index (clear all pending changes), 
returns the working directory to the last committed state. 

Q3.3 Use git checkout to get an older committed version ('ketch' commit)
Include the filename 'marlin' so we will not have a detached head. 
Commit it back to use the old version
Commands:
$ git checkout dabc8 -- marlin
$ git commit -m"Wanted an older version of marlin"
